# ASCII mirrorer

I have an ASCII art that is facing right but I want it to face left so I can use it with `cowsay`.

The idea is to:
- Process ASCII strings from a file, make sure that they are even length.
- Map each character to a mirrored version (or something approximately similar) of itself
- Reverse the mapped strings, and write them to a file.

This way I can have Gondal facing left so that I can use it with cowsay.
